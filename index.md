### 🔭 Current Project
**ESP32 Tank with Thermal Vision Camera**  
An experimental robotic setup combining physics, electronics, and embedded systems to visualize heat signatures and motion. Currently developing and testing with Python.

---

### 🧠 About Me
I’m an undergraduate student at the **University of Madras**, deeply interested in **Physics** and exploring interdisciplinary research.

---
### Research interest
My research interest lies in understanding the thermodynamics of biological systems, focusing on how microstates and entropy shape organization, energy flow, and stability in living matter.
I aim to explore how statistical and quantum thermodynamics can explain the balance between order and disorder in cellular and molecular processes.

---

### 💡 Highlights
- Built and tested small physics experiment setups (Operational amplifier, Laser grating, Photocell).  
- Attended seminars and workshops on optics, lasers, and instrumentation.  
- Currently exploring **Raspberry Pi** and **ESP32** applications in scientific computational modelling.

### 📖 Classical & Modern Foundations
| Author / Year | Paper / Work | Concept | Key Insight |
|----------------|--------------|----------|--------------|
| **Ludwig Boltzmann (1872)** | *On the Relation between the Second Law of Thermodynamics and Probability Theory* | Statistical Mechanics | Introduced probabilistic interpretation of entropy, laying groundwork for kinetic theory. |
| **Max Planck (1900)** | *On the Law of Distribution of Energy in the Normal Spectrum* | Quantum Theory | Proposed quantization of energy — the birth of quantum physics. |
| **Albert Einstein (1905)** | *On a Heuristic Point of View Concerning the Production and Transformation of Light* | Photoelectric Effect | Suggested that light is quantized into photons, supporting Planck’s hypothesis. |
| **Albert Einstein (1905)** | *On the Motion of Small Particles Suspended in Liquids at Rest* | Brownian Motion | Provided empirical evidence for atoms and molecular motion. |
| **Niels Bohr (1913)** | *On the Constitution of Atoms and Molecules* | Atomic Structure | Developed quantized energy levels for electrons — model for hydrogen spectrum. |
