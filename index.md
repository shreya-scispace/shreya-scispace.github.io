    <p>
      I’m an undergraduate student deeply interested in <strong>Physics</strong> and 
      <strong>interdisciplinary research</strong>, exploring how thermodynamics and 
      quantum theory explain energy flow, entropy, and organization in living systems.  
      My goal is to bridge physics and biophysics through analytical and experimental approaches.
