## ⚙️ 1. Operational Amplifier (Op-Amp)
**Objective:** To study the characteristics of an operational amplifier as an inverting and non-inverting amplifier.  
**Apparatus:** IC 741, resistors, DC power supply, breadboard, connecting wires, CRO.  
**Procedure Summary:** Configured the Op-Amp in both inverting and non-inverting modes and recorded voltages to determine gain.  
**Observation:** Output voltage varied linearly with input within the active region.  
**Result:** Verified linear amplification and calculated voltage gain for each configuration.  
**Skills Used:** Circuit setup, CRO usage, data analysis.
